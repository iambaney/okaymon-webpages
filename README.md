**Web3 and dynamic data, top:**
![Web3 and dynamic data 1](./Leaderboard%20Assets/%23leaderboard_data_guide_1.jpg)
* Green boxes are data boxes that must be recalculated after every mint. They depend on point value and trait distribution within the collection at a given state.
* Blue boxes are read directly from token metadata and will be static
* "Mint" button will be a simple hyperlink to a designated minting page. The leaderboard should be web3 read-only and, ideally, not require a wallet connection.
* Wallet connection and transactions will be relegated to a seperate, very simple minting page. The simplest page possible for the transaction options we offer. We do not have this page prepared currently.
* Entry below "Ruling Sect" should be dynamically replaced with a tiny version of the appropriate icon (Day_sect_icon.png or Night_sect_icon.png) instead of being reported as text.

**Web3 and dynamic data, bottom:**
![Web3 and dynamic data 2](./Leaderboard%20Assets/%23leaderboard_data_guide_2.jpg)
* If possible, the order of contents in the tables should be sorted by point value and then re-sorted after after each mint when point value is recalculated.
* If this is not possible or is prohibitively difficult, list Gens in numerical order and leave the rest of the trait table data ordered as shown.
